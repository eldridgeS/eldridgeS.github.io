# Eldridge Surianto's ePortfolio â€“ eldridgeS.github.io

This is the source code for my personal ePortfolio website, designed to showcase my academic background, technical projects, and relevant coursework. The website is best viewed on a wide screen, though still usable on mobile

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is structured as a static webpage hosted on GitHub Pages at:
